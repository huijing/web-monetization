# Contributing Guidelines

We are glad you want to contribute to our project and here are some guidelines to help you do that.

## Development is done with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase and we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to manage them.

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add (or remove) the code for your intention.
3. Please make sure you follow the existing code conventions of the project.
4. Issue the pull request.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs via GitHub [issues](https://github.com/huijing/webmonetization/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/huijing/webmonetization/issues/new/choose).

## Write helpful bug reports

[Shelley Vohr](https://dev.to/codebytere/open-source-the-art-of-the-issue-pnd) wrote an excellent guide to writing bug reports for open source projects which I highly recommend reading. Our issue template covers the following:

* What did you expect to have happen?
* What actually happened?
* What are the steps to reproduce the issue?
* Did you answer all questions?

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Double quotes for HTML, single quotes for CSS and JS
* End your files in a new line

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
